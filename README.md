# JUKU_SEO
SEO tool



I apologize for any confusion. The provided Python code is meant to be run in a terminal or command prompt, and it interacts with the user to input a URL and then displays the analysis results in the terminal itself. Here's how you can run the code and see its output:

1. Copy the Python code provided in the previous response.

2. Open a text editor and paste the code into a new file, for example, `jukuSeo.py`.

3. Save the file.

4. Open a terminal or command prompt.

5. Navigate to the directory where you saved the `jukuSeo.py` file.

6. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python jukuSeo.py
```

7. The script will prompt you to enter a URL. Enter the URL of the webpage you want to analyze, for example:

```
Enter the URL to analyze: https://www.example.com
```

8. The script will then fetch the page content, perform basic SEO analysis, and display the results in the terminal.

Please note that this is a basic example and focuses on retrieving the title, meta description, and heading tags of a webpage. For a more comprehensive SEO analysis, you would need to consider other factors such as keyword usage, backlinks, page speed, mobile-friendliness, and more.
